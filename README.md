## Introduction.
This project is created with the porpouse of practicing the acquired data science skills during my master. The project will be based on Python. The objective, is to create a the best model in order to detect the most risky mortgages, with the objective od creating and developing and efective rsk management policy when deciding the approval of mortgages loan. As an extra, this project is made with the objective of taking the first steps in Github.

## The data
The dataset contains information about individuals that have received a mortgage loan. The dataset has a total of 20000 observations and 15 different variables. The description of the variables ara as follow: 

- id: Unique ID of the loan application.
- grade: LC assigned loan grade.
- annual_inc: The self-reported annual income provided by the borrower during registration.
- short_emp: 1 when employed for 1 year or less.
- emp_length_num: Employment length in years. Possible values are between 0 and 10 where 0 means less than one year and 10 means ten or more years.
- home_ownership: Type of home ownership.
- dti (Debt-To-Income Ratio): A ratio calculated using the borrower’s total monthly debt payments on the total debt obligations, excluding mortgage and the requested LC loan, divided by the borrower’s self-reported monthly income.
- purpose: A category provided by the borrower for the loan request.
- term: The number of payments on the loan. Values are in months and can be either 36 or 60.
- last_delinq_none: 1 when the borrower had at least one event of delinquency.
- last_major_derog_none: 1 borrower had at least 90 days of a bad rating.
- revol_util: Revolving line utilization rate, or the amount of credit the borrower is using relative to all available revolving credit.
- total_rec_late_fee: Late fees received to date.
- od_ratio: Overdraft ratio.
- bad_loan: 1 when a loan was not paid.

## Project process

The first step of the porject will be to load the data. After this, a EDA (Exploratory Data Anlysis will be carried out). With this information, i will carry out a preprocessing of the data (missing values, outliers, features selection) in order to try to improve the results of the model. Once this is done, I will apply different classification models in order to get the best possible results.
